Meetings constitute a very effective way for a team to discuss problems and take decisions.
Unfortunately, some times the end goal of a meeting, which is essentially taking a decision, is never achieved.
As a member of a very curious team, we wondered whether other companies have similar productivity issues with meetings.
My team conducted an extensive reasearch on this problem (It was mainly me, eating popcorns and reading several posts on Reddit) and tried to understand the fundamental issues. We separated the problem into 3 different phases:

* Pre-Meeting
- Participants have not thought about whether a meeting is required.
- No preparate has been done.
- Discussion plan is absent.

* During Meeting
- Crowded Participation
- A lot of diversions from the main discussion
- No transcripts are being taken during the meeting so important opinions are getting lost.

* After the meeting
- No actions taken
- If actions are taken, no follow-up meetings have been scheduled.
- No meeting summary in written form or video recordings
- If a conclusion has been reached, it is not formalized in an ADR, thus is not searchable.
