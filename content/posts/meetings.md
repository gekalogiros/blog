Meetings constitute a very effective way for a team to discuss problems and take decisions.

Unfortunately, many teams, including mine, abuse the ability to organize meetings and end end up failing the primary goal of such a ceremony 
which of course is taking a decision.

I was really curious about whether there are other teams out there having similar productivity issues. 
I kicked off an extensive reasearch (I was actually eating popcorns and reading several posts on Reddit) and tried to extract some intel that would later help my team become more effective when conducting meetings. 

The lifetime of a meeting consists of three different periods. Below, I describe the problems we have identified per phase:

* Pre-Meeting
- Organised a meeting that is not actually required.
- Preparation was not done by the attendees.
- Discussion plan is absent.

* During Meeting
- Meeting got over-crowded and there was no time for wide participation in the discussion.
- Too many diversion from the main discussion made the meeting irrelevant.
- No transcripts taken so important opinions got lost.

* After the meeting
- No actions taken
- If actions were taken, no follow-up meetings have been scheduled.
- No meeting summary published in written form or video recordings
- No official documentation captured the decision of the meeting.

How can these problems be solved though? My team tested the following framework and we noticed improvements in our decision making progress without wasting a lot of time in follow-up "business gatherings":

- Meetings should not be booked unless there is a super important topic that requires face-to-face discussion.
Meetings are the most expensive way of taking a decision and they must be the last resort. Many people, myself included, have taken the liberty to book a meeting for non-important reasons. Small daily desicions can be taken on Slack or other communication channels without spending the time of multiple people which hapen to be an expensive resource for the company. Having said that, a meeting is the best approach for taking important decisions super fast when required. Considering the positive impact that such a decision might have for the company, investing the time is totally worth it.

- Follow the single responsibility principle. 
Trying to squeeze multiple discussions within a single meeting requires super powers and most people don't have them.

- Feedback is better gathered through a wiki page rather than a meeting. 
If feedback is sought then consider documenting your thoughts on a wiki page before scheduling a meeting. Invite all parties to add comments to your document and once you have a good overview about what needs to be achieved and what each stakeholder believes, book a meeting with the key people representing all the different ideas. This will reduce the amount of meetings required and it will facilitate the process of taking a decision.

- The scope of a meetings needs to be clear for all participants. This is done better through documentation.
An agenda needs to be put together before the time of the meeting. The agenda needs to be in a public wiki if possible. Any useful resources that will bring attendees up to speed with what will be discussed should go to the wiki page as well. Also add a section called "Actions". This section will be used during or at the end of the meeting to capture any actions. Documenting all these details can be a good approach so that things are not forgotten.
