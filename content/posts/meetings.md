Meetings constitute a very effective way for a team to discuss problems and take decisions.
Unfortunately, many teams, including time, abuse the ability to organize meetings ending up failing the main goal of such a ceremony which is taking a decision.
I was really curious about whether there are other teams out there having similar productivity issues. I kicked off an extensive reasearch (I was actually eating popcorns and reading several posts on Reddit) and tried to extract some intel 
that would later help my team become more effective when conducting meetings. 

The lifetime of a meeting consists of three different periods. Below, I describe the problems I have identified per phase:

* Pre-Meeting
- Organised a meeting that is not actually required.
- Preparation was not done by the attendees.
- Discussion plan is absent.

* During Meeting
- Meeting got over-crowded and there was no time for wide participation in the discussion.
- Too many diversion from the main discussion made the meeting irrelevant.
- No transcripts taken so important opinions got lost.

* After the meeting
- No actions taken
- If actions were taken, no follow-up meetings have been scheduled.
- No meeting summary published in written form or video recordings
- No official documentation captured the decision of the meeting.

How can these problems be solved though? My team tested the following framework:

- Meetings should not be booked unless there is a super important topic that need to be discussed.
Meetings are the most expensive way of taking a decision and they must be the last resort. Many people, myself included, have taken the liberty to book a meeting for non-important things. Small, daily desicions can be taken on Slack or other communication channels without spending the time of X people. Having said that, a meeting is the best approach for taking important decisions super fast. Considering the positive impact that such a decision might have for the company, investing the times is totally worth it.

- Follow the single responsibility principle for meetings as well. 
Trying to squeeze multiple discussions within a single meeting requires super powers and most people don't have them. 

- If a decision requires involvement of multiple teams and strict coordination think about creating a wiki page with thoughts and ask for feedback there.
