I woke up with a mood of refreshing my blog today. 

I went through the content of my old million-times-hacked-wordpress website and decided to give something new a try.

The only requirement I set was my new blog to be not a dynamic website. 

After some deep 5-min research, I ended up setting up a Jekyll and a Hugo template project. 

Long story short, I felt more comfortable with Hugo, mainly because I found a really clean and miminal template from [Vicky Lai](https://vickylai.com/) called [Call me Sam](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/).

Hope you like it!
