I am a big fan of the Agile development process. I am also a big fan of Scrum. Below I will post a quick description about how are ceremonies look like:

# Standup

*When:* Every day
*Duration:* 10 minutes
*Location:* team area

This is the typical 10 minute meeting that most teams have every day. We chose to do it in the morning so that we kick-start the day we something to do or solve any blockers awaiting from the previous day. Making the standup part of my daily routine means that I should always be prepared to talk about the work I've done. Every person has memory outages some times and because I want to avoid this situation I'm using a command line tool to keep all the tasks I did the day before handy. In the standup we need to accomplish the following
* Communicate with the team what you're working on
* Communicate with the team what you'll be working on
* Discuss any blockers or help people with any problems they're having
* Not having unanswered questions. After the standup everyone needs to know what the other team members are working on. If you don't then you need to ask.

# Pre-Grooming
*When:* Once every week
*Duration:* 30 minutes
*Location:* Team Lead's desk

This is a sessions including the very senior members of the technical team along with any product owners. The aim of this meeting is to review stories and find the ones that are top priority. In order to help the technical team as part of this session more information may be added to the ticket so that it is ready to pick up by any member of the team. 

# Grooming

This is a regular 1-hour session including the whole team where we discuss new stories and we estimate them. Normally we assist estimation by using our estimation poker cards and agree the complexity and testing that each story requires.

# Review

# Retros

This is one of the most impostant sessions of our Scrum process. We spend 15-20 minutes writing all the good/bad things happened in the sprint and we discuss about them.
