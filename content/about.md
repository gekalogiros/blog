Hello! I am Georgios. I like programming, cycling and photography!

My tech journey started many many years a go in a galaxy far far away when I started programming in [Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)) and [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)).

It was super exciting! 

It taught me how be creative! 

I graduated from [Computer Engineering and Informatics Department](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en) of [University of Patras](http://www.upatras.gr/en) and I hold an MSc on Internet Technologies and Security from [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/). 

Currently, I solve problems with code for fun and profit. 

When I'm not coding you'll find me cycling and thinking about problems that I wasn't able to solve the day before.
